# My portfolio website

So, I basically wanted a personal website and thought "Why not build it myself?" Feel free to use this project for your own website if you find it useful :)

## Getting Started 🚀

### Prerequisites 📋

You'll need [Git](https://git-scm.com) and [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) (which comes with [NPM](http://npmjs.com)) installed on your computer.

```
node@v16.4.2 or higher
npm@7.18.1 or higher
git@2.30.1 or higher
```

Also, you can use [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) instead of NPM ☝️

```
yarn@v1.22.10 or higher
```

---

## How To Use 🔧

From your command line, first clone Simplefolio:

```bash
# Clone the repository
$ git clone https://github.com/jdboisvert/jdboisvert.github.io.git

# Move into the repository
$ cd jdboisvert.github.io
```

After that, you can install the dependencies either using NPM or Yarn.

Using NPM: Simply run the below commands.

```bash
# 2022 Update - Fix Dependencies
$ npm audit fix
$ npm i @parcel/transformer-sass

# Install dependencies
$ npm install

# Start the development server
$ npm start
```

Using Yarn: Be aware of that you'll need to delete the `package-lock.json` file before executing the below commands.

```bash
# Install dependencies
$ yarn

# Start the development server
$ yarn start
```

**NOTE**:
If your run into issues installing the dependencies with NPM, use this below command:

```bash
# Install dependencies with all permissions
$ sudo npm install --unsafe-perm=true --allow-root
```

Once your server has started, go to this url `http://localhost:1234/` to see the portfolio locally. It should look like the below screenshot.
